Media Pack addon for Minetest Laptop Mod
-------------by Grizzly Adam------------

Adds 5 1/4" Double Density Floppy Disk, Compact Disc, D-C60 Cassette Tape, Punch Card, and Disk Storage unit. Disk storage uses code from Itemshelf mod to make the disk in slot one visible within the disk storage item.

Known Issue: Media in disk storage unit may not face the proper direction based on orientation of the storage unit. This is a bug from ItemShelf. If you have a solution, please let me know.
